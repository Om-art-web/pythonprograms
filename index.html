    <h1>Om Vishwakarma</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Om — a Class 12 student with a strong passion for Python programming. I'm particularly interested in image and video processing, and I've already developed a project that combines both these areas using Python. I love exploring how technology can bring ideas to life, and I’m constantly learning new tools and techniques to sharpen my skills in programming and computer vision.
